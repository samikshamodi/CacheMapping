#  Cache Mapping
It is a program that simulates the 3 different types of cache mapping techniques namely - direct, fullt associative and n-way set associative. I wrote this program in my second semester at IIITD for my course Computer Organization.

## Usage
- The program is written in Python 3.6.9
- Clone this reposiotry to your desktop
- Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.
- Run level1.py (for level 1 cache) using the following command
```
python3 level1.py
```
- Run level2.py (for level 2 cache) using the following command
```
python3 level2.py
```
- Then enter the input as instructed
